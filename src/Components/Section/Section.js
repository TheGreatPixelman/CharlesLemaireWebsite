                                <p>Hey there! i'm Charles a soon to be graduate of the √âTS in software engineering! 
                                    I enjoy working with different 3D tools to create simulations and 
                                    interaction between different systems, My favorite software to date is Unity3D where i make most 
                                    of my games and projects. I hope that one day i'll have the guts to release something good 
                                    and start my own studio! </p>
                                <p>
