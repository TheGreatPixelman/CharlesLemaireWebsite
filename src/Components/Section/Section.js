                                <p>Hey there! I'm Charles, a soon to be of √âTS in software engineering! 
                                    I enjoy working with different Modeling and game engines softwares to create simulations and 
                                    interactions between different systems. My favorite software to date is Unity3D where i make most 
                                    of my games and projects. I hope that one day I'll have the ability to release my first game 
                                    and start my own studio! </p>
